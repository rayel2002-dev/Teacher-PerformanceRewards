Contract Address
The contract address for the deployed Teacher Rewards Smart Contract is not yet available as the contract needs to be deployed to a blockchain network. You will receive the contract address after deployment.

Future Scope
Performance Metrics Enhancement: Implement more sophisticated performance evaluation criteria and metrics.
Reward Calculation Improvement: Introduce dynamic reward calculation mechanisms based on performance thresholds or additional factors.
Role-Based Access Control: Implement more granular access control to allow different roles (e.g., reviewers) in addition to the manager.
User Interface: Develop a web-based user interface to interact with the smart contract, making it more accessible and user-friendly.
Audit and Security: Perform comprehensive security audits and incorporate best practices to enhance contract security.
